This is software to be operated by *POA bridge validators* to faciliate proof-of-authority
based briding of POA to tokens on an **another** Ethereum-based blockchain.

The validators work with POA bridge contracts to convert ether on one chain into the same
amount of ERC20 tokens on the other and back.

This software works in conjunction with other projects:

* [POA Bridge UI](https://github.com/poanetwork/bridge-ui)
* [POA Bridge Smart Contracts](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-bridge-contracts)
* [POA Bridge Monitoring service](https://github.com/poanetwork/bridge-monitor)
* [POA Bridge Deployment scripts](https://github.com/poanetwork/deployment-bridge)

### Functionality

The bridge connects two chains (`home` and `foreign`). When a user deposits ether into the
bridge contract contract on `home` they get the same amount of ERC20 tokens on `foreign`,
and they can convert them back as well.

#### Deposit

#### Withdraw

![withdraw](./res/withdraw.png)

### How to build 

Requires `rust` and `cargo`: [installation instructions.](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)

Requires `solc` to be in `$PATH`: [installation instructions.](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installing-solidity.html)

Assuming you've cloned the bridge (`git clone git@github.com:poanetwork/poa-bridge.git`), run

```
cd poa-bridge
make
```

and install `../target/release/bridge` in your `$PATH`.

### Running

```
bridge --config config.toml --database db.toml
```

- `--config` - location of the configuration file. configuration file must exist
- `--database` - location of the database file.

#### Exit Status Codes

|    7 | Nonce reused         |
|   10 | Cannot connect       |
|   11 | Connection lost      |
|   12 | Bridge crashed       |
